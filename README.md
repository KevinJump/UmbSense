# UmbSense vscode

Visual Studio code extensions to add umbraco tags to html intelisense. 

# Debugging 
Open this folder in vscode and run debug task (F5) that should open another
copy of vscode with the intellisense loaded.

# TODO
- [ ] Add All the tags,
- [ ] Come up with a way to build the individual tag json files into one big one for release
